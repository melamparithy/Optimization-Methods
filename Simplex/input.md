Input Format
The input will be given from the Stdin.
The test cases will be of the form:
The first line contains three integers: n, u, and v.
The second line contains n numbers, denoting the vector c.
The next u + v lines contain n numbers each.
The first u lines denote the coefficients of the decision variables in inequalities
of the form ≤.
The next v lines denote the coefficients of the decision variables in inequalities
of the form ≥.
The final line contains u + v numbers, which denote the R.H.S values of the
u + v constraints given, or in other terms, the vector b.
You have to convert the given input to the standard form mentioned in (1) and
then solve it. Remember that all the inputs except u, v and n are real numbers,
not integers.
